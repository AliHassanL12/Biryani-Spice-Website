# Biryani-Spice-Website

This project is a project made to speed up my learning journey by undertaking a task that is outside of my comfort zone. You can only learn when you push yoursels, and despite learning resources being amazing- it is imperative to do more.

This website in particular is built taking my father's restaurant business as inspiration. The aim is to create a website that shows the different dishes and allows customers to easily decide what they want to eat well before they reach the restaurant. As such, User Experience is the primary focus and ensuring that the website is as easy to navigate as possible is important to the success of this project.
